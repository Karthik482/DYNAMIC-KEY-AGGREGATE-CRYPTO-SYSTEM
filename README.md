# DYNAMIC-KEY-AGGREGATE-CRYPTO-SYSTEM


This project is aimed to add extra security layer to the existing security system of cloud while transferring data between multiple users.

To transfer data between multiple users without compromising about size and
security I introduced a new random aggregate key with constant size. The random
aggregate key is a dynamic key that expires on the requirements of the user.
