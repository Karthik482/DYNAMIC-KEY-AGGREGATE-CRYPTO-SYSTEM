# DYNAMIC-KEY-AGGREGATE-CRYPTO-SYSTEM


This project is based on the given below research paper -
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6497048

To transfer data between multiple users without compromising about size and
security I introduced a new random aggregate key with constant size. The random
aggregate key is a dynamic key that expires on the requirements of the user.
